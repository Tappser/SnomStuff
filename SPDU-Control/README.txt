This is the stuff i use to control my Masterswitch 9212 with my Snom 870.

Provisioning on the Snom-Phone is set to my homeserver/provision.php

That way it gets the actual state on boot and the correct configuration for the buttons.

The Phone DOES NOT get noticed when the PDU-Ports are switched from other sources.

But thats not that much of a problem.
